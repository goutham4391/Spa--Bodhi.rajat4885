										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hyperpigmentation, also known as sun spots, age spots, dark spots, brown marks or the &lsquo;mask of pregnancy&rsquo;, is so common among Australian women, especially given our climate. We all have it, and it&rsquo;s so easy to get. Most often caused by UV exposure over many years, anyone who&rsquo;s spent any time at the beach &ndash; which is pretty much everyone in Western Australia &ndash; will have it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BODHI Facialist and Spa Trainer, Tegan Hall shares her no-nonsense skin care tips for men. Soap is a no-go for the face as it dries out the skin. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to take a leap into a good all-natural facial routine. At the very least cleanse (with a cleanser) and moisturise! Your skin will thank you for it. This is non-negotiable. Sunscreen isn&rsquo;t just for the beach or outdoor sports.</p>
