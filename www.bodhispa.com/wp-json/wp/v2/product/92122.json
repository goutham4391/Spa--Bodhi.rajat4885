Please note our Supernatural 72-Hour Cr\u00e8me has changed packaging in June 2021 to a refillable plastic jar with a refill pod. If you still have an older glass jar, you\u2019ll need to purchase the new jar initially, then you\u2019ll be able to purchase refill pods on-going. You can still return your empty pod and original jar to us for recycling &#8211; simply send them back to us (using our free returns label) to be sterilised and refilled through our circularity initiative &#8211; Beauty Circle.<\/p>\n<p>By purchasing a refill you are reducing your impact by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Up to 74% less CO2 emissions*<\/li>\n<li>60% less energy**<\/li>\n<li>45% less water**<\/li>\n<li>Minimising the 114 billion units of beauty packaging discarded each year***<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We think endlessly producing new things instead of using what we have makes zero sense. Why would we extract new things from the ground, use more energy, more water and produce more carbon, when we can use the valuable materials we already have. It also makes zero sense to recycle* things after a single use (using more energy and omitting more carbon) when they are strong enough to last many uses! Sounds silly doesn\u2019t it? We agree. It\u2019s time to go circular.
