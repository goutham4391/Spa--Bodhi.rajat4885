What does it do?<\/h3>\n<p>We have over 100 highly effective and consciously sourced natural ingredients.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d say every ingredient in Sodashi products is a star! \u00a0But one of our superstar ingredients \u2013 Centella Asiatica, contains a bunch of biologically active components (terpenoids) which slow down the degradation of collagen \u2013 in fact Centella Asiatica stimulates collagen fibroplasts, which is necessary for maintaining the structure, firmness and elasticity of our skin.<\/p>\n<p>Another important fact &#8211; Sodashi uses ingredients rich in natural vitamins, so they are easy for the skin to absorb.<\/p>\n<h3>If someone is new to Sodashi \u2013 what three products would you recommend they start with?<\/h3>\n<p>Cleanse, Compress, Moisturise.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/product\/rejuvenating-clay-cleanser-with-lavender-150ml\/\">Sodashi Clay Cleanser<\/a> is a wonderful, creamy cleanser you apply to the skin with a small amount of water and when you remove it leaves your skin cleansed, but without any tight feeling.<\/p>\n<p>Follow your cleansing with the Sodashi Cell Renewal drops \u2013 they are what I refer to as a \u2018skin gamechanger\u2019, since they will positively reset your skin and the aromas are calming, balancing, and lifting for the mood.<\/p>\n<p>Finish with your recommended <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/product\/rejuvenating-face-and-neck-moisturiser-100ml\/\">Sodashi Moisturiser<\/a>, no matter whether you have oily or dry skin our moisturiser formulas will give you the exact amount of moisture your skin needs.<\/p>\n<h3>What\u2019s the magic that happens in the Sodashi <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/product\/bodhi-chakra-balance\/\">Chakra Balance treatment<\/a>?<\/h3>\n<p>Chakras are main energy hubs in our body, which when they are balanced, they will support us mentally, physically, spiritually, and emotionally.<\/p>\n<p>This unique treatment is a combination of a deeply meditative experience with bodywork purposefully created to bring the chakras into alignment through a fluid combination of massage, specialised essential oil synergies and specific crystals.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/product\/bodhi-chakra-balance\/\">Chakra Balance treatment<\/a> works subtly on the energetic body, but with profound effect for your wellbeing, so you will feel calm, centred and in a delightful state of harmony after this incredible treatment.<\/p>\n<h3>What\u2019s the go-to Sodashi product for redness and irritated skin?<\/h3>\n<p>The cooling and calming effect of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/product\/calming-skin-boost-50ml\/\">Sodashi Calming Skin Boost<\/a> will immediately calm and soothe red or irritated skin.<\/p>\n<p>I also use the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/product\/calming-skin-boost-50ml\/\">Calming Skin Boost<\/a> on insect bites because it takes away the inflammation and the itchiness and I\u2019m never left with any scarring or red marks.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Essential oils are a key ingredient in Sodashi, which 3 are your favourites, and why?\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Lavender<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is\u00a0is powerfully healing and regenerating for the skin. I\u2019ve seen Lavender renew skin that has been burnt badly, as well reduce scarring, and calm inflamed and irritated skins.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Geranium\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is\u00a0such an effective skin balancer, balancing the skin\u2019s natural oil secretion so it\u2019s great for oily and dry skins, as well it boosts our skin\u2019s health and natural glow.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Frankincense<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It has cytophylactic properties (which means it protects the cells and helps generate new skin cells) \u2013 so it\u2019s incredibly beneficial for skin dryness, reducing wrinkles and improving our skin tone.<\/p>\n<h3>Can you tell us about the vibrational qualities of essential oils, and what benefits they provide?<\/h3>\n<p>Essential oils are derived by distillation or extraction from pure plant source and are thought to have the highest vibrational frequencies of any organic substance on the planet!\u00a0 Starting at 52MHz and through to a whopping 320 MHz (which is what Sodashi\u2019s pure Damask Rose essential oil from Turkey resonates at).<\/p>\n<p>Essential oils entrain the cells of the body to increase their vibratory rate, and research has shown that they positively improve your mood and your physical health.<\/p>\n<h3>What new natural ingredients are you most excited about now? And what are its qualities?<\/h3>\n<p>We have a beautiful new product release coming up with some exciting new ingredients &#8211; one ingredient is highly prized in skin care, containing essential proteins for the skin and it\u2019s also rich in vitamin C.\u00a0 I can\u2019t say too much yet, but I can say I have been trialling the product and now I can\u2019t do without it!<\/p>\n<h3>What\u2019s you biggest tip for beautiful skin in summer?<\/h3>\n<p>For summer, exfoliate regularly (at least twice a week) and moisturise twice a day.\u00a0 Air conditioning, sun, swimming will dry and dehydrate the skin so it\u2019s important to replenish moisture.<\/p>\n<p>Exfoliation and removing surface dead skin cells ensures you get the most from your moisturiser, because it can absorb in to the deeper layers of the skin and that\u2019s when it will be the most effective.<\/p>\n<h3>What\u2019s coming next for Sodashi?<\/h3>\n<p>We are continuing to do what we do best \u2013 creating transformational skincare, so we have an amazing year planned with exciting new product releases, and we also have a relaunch of some Sodashi favourites in beautiful new packaging.<\/p>\n<h3>Which BODHI spa do you usually visit when you are in Perth and why?<\/h3>\n<p>I believe the most relaxing spa experience should begin moment you arrive and not end until you leave the spa.<\/p>\n<p>At the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/location\/highgate\/\">Bodhi Highgate Spa<\/a> I always have this feeling, a warm greeting, the sublime experience of being nurtured and nourished with my favourite Sodashi treatment, and the post spa experience, relaxing and enjoying the delicious Bodhi treat in the Bali inspired garden, or the relaxation room in winter.<\/p>\n<p>Shop <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/brand\/sodashi\/?filtered=sodashi\">Sodashi<\/a> at BODHI Spas and earn BODHI Rewards points for some extra self-care.
