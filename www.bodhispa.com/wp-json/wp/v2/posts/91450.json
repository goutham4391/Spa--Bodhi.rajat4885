Whilst we were sad to leave Injidup Spa Retreat, all good things must come to an end, and we are beyond excited to \u00a0have our very own beautiful five-star retreat down south in which to nurture you.<\/h4>\n<p>BODHI Yallingup is be our most luxurious wellness destination yet. Custom designed, it has five exquisite couples\u2019 suites, an infrared sauna, hydrotherapy baths, as well as a yoga\/meditation studio. A key feature of the spa is the beautiful relax lounge and spa terrace, both overlooking Lake Gunyulgup, where the serenity is literally palpable.<\/p>\n<p>We spoke to BODHI Founder Tania Taylor, about her vision for the new BODHI Yallingup Spa.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h4><strong>Where did the inspiration for BODHI Yallingup come from?\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>We\u2019ve been looking to open a stand-alone BODHI spa in the Yallingup area for some time, it&#8217;s a place we love to escape to personally, to unwind, relax and recharge. We wanted to extend the BODHI Spa offering in the beautiful Margaret River Region, and create an understated yet luxurious retreat, with a stand-out wellness offering.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h4><strong> Will there be spa treatments unique to BODHI Yallingup?\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>BODHI Yallingup will offer the full <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/product-category\/treatments\/facials\/\">BODHI Spa Menu<\/a>, and we\u2019ll be introducing a BODHI Yallingup spa journey, with a beautiful signature product early in 2023, using Western Australian sourced botanicals.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h4><strong>How do you hope guests feel after visiting?\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Deeply relaxed, rejuvenated, inspired and empowered! At BODHI we seek not only to completely nurture our guests, but also to inspire and empower them toward a greater state of health, balance and wellbeing.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h4><strong>What are you most excited about BODHI Yallingup?\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The fact that it overlooks a tranquil lake makes this spa very special; it brings a deeper peace and serenity to the retreat. And we have designed this space from the ground up, it will be our most considered BODHI Spa offering yet, every single detail has been thought of.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h4><strong>Is the focus be on beauty and body treatments, or will BODHI Yallingup also offer food, outdoor experiences etc?\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The focus is be on all-natural beauty and body treatments, underpinned with a deep wellbeing offering such as LED light facial therapy, spa baths, infrared sauna, reiki. During Retreat events we&#8217;ll also be offering yoga and sound healing. And BODHI always serves post-treatment refreshments to all guests, and lunch offerings will be available for those having extended half-day or full-day spa experiences.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h4><strong>Why Yallingup?\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The Yallingup region is very close to our hearts, it\u2019s where Danny, my husband and co-Founder of BODHI, and I escape to regularly to recharge. Ten minutes from the beach, the Gunyulgup location of the Spa is very peaceful, water-fronting, amongst the trees, often surrounded by kangaroos!<\/p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<h4><strong>How has nature played a role in the design of BODHI Yallingup?\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Nature has been integral to the design and layout of the BODHI Yallingup spa. We\u2019ve sought to maximise the connection to the beautiful natural surroundings, with floor to ceiling windows in treatment rooms, and a beautiful waterfront lounge and relax balcony.<\/p>\n<p>A meditation\/yoga studio on the ground floor also opens-up on to the lake, enhancing the tranquillity of the space. Skylights bring in natural light to a curved corridor, a unique feature within the spa. The d\u00e9cor will also reflect the palette of the beautiful Margaret River region.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For more information, please contact our team at BODHI Yallingup: <a href=\"mailto:yallingup@bodhispa.com\">yallingup@bodhispa.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>We look forward to welcoming you and nurturing you at our new BODHI Yallingup spa soon!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After five beautiful years at Injidup, BODHI has a brand new water-front home in the tranquil surrounds of Lake Gunyulgup.
