This exquisite lake-side wellness retreat works in harmony with the natural surroundings, delivering immersive holistic treatments, to indulge, restore and revitalise mind and body, and deeply care for your soul.<\/h5>\n<p>This tranquil location is unique, on the shores of spring-fed Lake Gunyulgup, a traditional camping place and area of significance for the Wardandi Noongar Moort families. Fittingly for the spa, the word Gunyulgup means \u2018place of rest\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>With custom interior design by Pattern Studio, the 520 square meter <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/location\/yallingup-margaret-river\/\">BODHI Yallingup<\/a> features six luxury treatment rooms, five of which are couples\u2019 suites, an infrared sauna, hydrotherapy baths, as well as a water-fronting yoga\/meditation studio. A secluded relax lounge and spa terrace, also overlooking the lake, bring a deeper peace and serenity to the retreat.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/location\/yallingup-margaret-river\/?utm_source=mrbta&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=2022-mrbta-membership\">BODHI Yallingup<\/a> is our most considered BODHI Spa offering yet. With a $2 million fit-out, every single detail has been thought of,\u201d explains BODHI Founder, Tania Taylor.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNature has been integral to the layout and palette of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/location\/yallingup-margaret-river\/\">BODHI Yallingup<\/a>. Floor to ceiling windows and a water-fronting yoga studio, relax lounge and terrace, allow a palpable connection to the natural surroundings. Skylights bring natural light into a curved central corridor, and the neutral, warm palette is inspired by the pristine coastal Margaret River region, providing a beautiful sense of place. And the wildlife is abundant! Don\u2019t be surprised to see kangaroos grazing at the lakes\u2019 edge as you unwind on the spa terrace,\u201d Tania added.<\/p>\n<p>The BODHI Group has a tread lightly approach, and sustainability was a major consideration in the Yallingup spa build.\u00a0 <strong>Seventy-one solar panels<\/strong> on the roof meet the bulk of the spa\u2019s energy needs, and a <strong>220 thousand litre rainwater tank<\/strong> provides all the spa\u2019s water. The landscaping surrounding BODHI Yallingup was carefully considered, with a range of water-wise native flora.<\/p>\n<p>Lily Goodwin, Principal at Pattern Studio explains, \u201cOur intention with the design was to create a sense of utter serenity, cultivating a feeling of calm and balance. The design is intentionally understated so as not to compete with or detract from vistas to the surrounding landscape. We hope that guests feel an ultimate sense of relaxation; in every sense of the word. Bodhi are specialists at creating a warm, inviting atmosphere; this new space was designed to be an extension of this ethos.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/BodhiSpaYallingup_TreatmentRooms-30.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-95688 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/BodhiSpaYallingup_TreatmentRooms-30-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"506\" height=\"337\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/BodhiSpaYallingup_TreatmentRooms-30-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/BodhiSpaYallingup_TreatmentRooms-30-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/BodhiSpaYallingup_TreatmentRooms-30-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/BodhiSpaYallingup_TreatmentRooms-30-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/BodhiSpaYallingup_TreatmentRooms-30-1x1.jpg 1w, https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/BodhiSpaYallingup_TreatmentRooms-30-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/BodhiSpaYallingup_TreatmentRooms-30.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px\" \/><\/a> Inspiring a commitment to wellness, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/location\/yallingup-margaret-river\/\">BODHI Yallingup<\/a> offers a deep-rooted approach to wellness, combining hands-on healing and holistic treatments, using the finest natural hand-crafted products by Sodashi, MUKTI Organics and Emma Lewisham.
