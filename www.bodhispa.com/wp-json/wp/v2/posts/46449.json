I eat carrots with hummus and or nuts and seeds and in between. I also love the occasional raw treat like a bliss ball.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll have a glass of GLOW Inner Beauty Powder with a splash of COLLAGEN Inner Beauty Boost in the morning \u2013 they make up my internal beauty routine. GLOW is like my internal moisturiser and COLLAGEN is like my internal skin serum.<\/p>\n<p>Protein is very important for breakfast and to have throughout the day as it is probably the best way to maintain metabolic efficiency, keep you feeling fuller for longer and keeping your blood sugar levels balanced. It also helps to increase your basal metabolic rate.<\/p>\n<h3>What is your biggest wellness discovery?<\/h3>\n<p>My biggest wellness discovery ever is prebiotics and probiotics. Prebiotics and probiotics work to improve gut health and boost your immune system. They also support the body\u2019s detoxification and elimination pathways. Probiotics directly neutralise certain chemicals and toxins so that they don\u2019t have to be processed through the liver. This helps to ease the burden on the liver and the skin. A happy gut also means a healthy immune system, healthier skin, better absorption of nutrients, metabolism of hormones.<\/p>\n<p>More and more studies are showing the link between skin health and gut health. Where there is gut inflammation, there will be skin inflammation. People who have a healthier gut microbiota, have a healthier fatty acid profile in their skin, therefore their skin is more hydrated, moisturised and plumper.<\/p>\n<h3>Which is your favourite Bodhi treatment and why?<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve not had the chance to have a spa treatment at Bodhi yet \u2013 it\u2019s on my \u2018to do\u2019 list for when I next visit Perth! I\u2019d like to try the Lymphatic Drainage Massage, I love a therapeutic massage with all-natural products.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I am a big believer that \u201cbeauty begins in the belly\u201d \u2013 that gut health is paramount for healthy, radiant skin and overall wellbeing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":46686,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false},"categories":[57,54],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/46449"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=46449"}],"version-history":[{"count":10,"href":"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/46449\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":47462,"href":"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/46449\/revisions\/47462"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/46686"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=46449"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=46449"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=46449"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
