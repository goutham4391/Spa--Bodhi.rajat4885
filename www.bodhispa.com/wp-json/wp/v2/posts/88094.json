It releases physical and mental stress and tension, and has an overall energising effect.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s said to break down energy blockages, to promote a consistent flow of energy throughout the body to reduce feelings of fatigue, enhance learning and memory, promote mental clarity, and physical healing.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reiki therapy reminds our bodies to go back into the \u2018repair mode\u2019 or \u2018self-healing\u2019 state of rest and digest. In this state, our bodies are triggered to cleanse themselves of useless or stale energies. It allows the body to protect itself from exhaustion, and burnout, and is also said to promote better sleep.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where does <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/product\/bodhi-reiki\/\">Reiki<\/a> originate from?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reiki was developed in 1920\u2019s by Mikao Usui in Japan, as a spiritual practice.\u00a0A lay monk with a wife and two children, Usui was a seeker of knowledge and spiritual understanding. He studied disciplines such as history, religion, medicine, psychology, and metaphysics, and broadened his world view through travel to Europe and China. This culminated in a profound revelation during his meditation practice that led to the therapy now called Reiki.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What can you expect in your first <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/product\/bodhi-reiki\/\">Reiki<\/a> session?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During a Reiki session your therapist will gently place their hands either directly on you or just above you, bringing about healing energy. Most people feel a sense of peace, it works to calm the mind and completely relax the body.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may feel subtle energy gently moving through the body, as well as a sense of warmth and nurturing from the hands of the therapist.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/product\/bodhi-reiki\/\"> Reiki<\/a> safe for everyone?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reiki is not harmful in any way, and it is safe to use Reiki in conjunction with chemotherapy, radiation, and medications used in the medical treatment of cancer, for example. Reiki is used as a complement to \u2014 never as a substitute for \u2014 regular medical treatment and medications.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/product\/bodhi-reiki\/\">Reiki<\/a> be added to a facial or massage at BODHI?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes absolutely, Reiki will amplify the benefits of a BODHI facial or massage. I\u2019d recommend adding Reiki at the end of your treatment, as you are then more comfortable with the therapists\u2019 touch and feeling very relaxed, to fully benefit from this nurturing therapy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspired you to become a Reiki practitioner?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was completing my massage training and during our clinic time I found myself absorbing everyone else\u2019s energy. My lecturer and mentor recommended I learn Reiki to help me channel my energy, as well as the energy of the guest I was working on.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Studying Reiki helped me to understand energy, how to give back to me, and how to channel energy. As I became more adept at Reiki and witnessed it\u2019s many befefits, I decided I wanted to share the Reiki modality with others, so I completed my masters in Reiki.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does it feel as the therapist to give a Reiki treatment?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giving Reiki feels absolutely amazing. As a therapist Reiki is very relaxing, it\u2019s almost like you are in a meditative state of relaxation yourself. The connection with your guests can be so wonderful.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Base on your knowledge of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/product\/bodhi-reiki\/\">Reiki<\/a>, can you share with us a wellbeing tool to use at home? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a wellbeing exercise that I always find helpful, and something anyone can do while sitting with themselves and their energy. I was shown it a while ago and I still use it today.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Placing both palms on your chest or over your heart. Take a few nice deep breathes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feel the warmth of your hands over this area. Once you feel the warmth and energy from your hands envision a beautiful yellow or golden light flowing through softening that area allowing goodness in, letting love in, all your stresses melt away.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After some time envision the light becoming brighter and bigger. Feeling the warmth of your hands like the sun. Feel this light getting bigger and bigger and now filling your whole being. Allow your body to really feel that beautiful yellow or golden light. All that is.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This beautiful yellow or golden light is now beaming out into the room you are sitting in, and into the building or area you are in. As you start to bring yourself back to where you are sitting remember this light is forever with you. You can always bring the light back to you whenever you need. Take 3 deep breaths. Slowly open your eyes and become aware of where you are, in the here and now.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We asked Robyn McCullough, BODHI&#8217;s resident Reiki Master, all about Reiki and it&#8217;s benefits, and why you should add it to your next BODHI treatment. &nbsp; What is Reiki and how does it work?
