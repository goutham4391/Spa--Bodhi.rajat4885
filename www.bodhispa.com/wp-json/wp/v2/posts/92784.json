What excited you about the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/location\/yallingup-margaret-river\/\">BODHI Yallingup<\/a> location?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The site is very special. This BODHI Spa is located within close proximity to the ocean; guests can travel from the the shores of Smiths Beach to the doorstep of BODHI within minutes. The building\u2019s relationship to the landscape, particularly to the lake, was carefully considered in the planning of the spa. Views to surrounding treetops and the body of water are framed to create a strong connection between guests and the serene environment at the Yallingup site.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. How would you describe the palette of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/location\/yallingup-margaret-river\/\">BODHI Yallingup<\/a> spa?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Refreshing, serene. The palette incorporates natural materials, neutral tones, and uplifting colour accents.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. What did you draw on as inspiration for the design of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/location\/yallingup-margaret-river\/\">BODHI Yallingup<\/a>?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the result is fairly contemporary and minimal in its style and execution; in design aspects such as spatial planning and lighting we drew inspiration from the architecture of ancient spa cultures. Turkish Hamams and Japanese Onsens, in particular, offered a wealth of insight into the history and rituals of bathing culture.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. How does the design compliment the beautiful south west WA location of the spa?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our intention with the design was to create a sense of utter serenity, cultivating a feeling of calm and balance. The design is intentionally understated so as not to compete with or detract from vistas to the surrounding landscape.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. What are the stand out design features of the spa?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The site\u2019s relationship with the natural landscape is truly unique; and makes for a deeply relaxing guest experience. Elegant treatment rooms, understated yet luxurious bath houses, and a sumptuous relaxation lounge have been conceptualised with timeless, rather than trend-driven, design in mind. The spaces feature some exquisite furnishings and fittings; think contemporary European furnishings, Australian artwork, and handmade ceramic light fittings.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. What were the goals for the feel and look of the space?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our aim was to craft a space that felt elegant yet understated, contemporary yet timeless, harmonious yet never bland.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. How do you want the guest to feel when they visit the spa?<\/h4>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We hope that guests feel the ultimate sense of relaxation; in every sense of the word. BODHI are specialists at creating a warm, inviting atmosphere; this new space was designed to be an extension of this ethos. The new spa is the physical embodiment of BODHI\u2019s unwavering commitment to crafting exceptional and memorable spa experiences.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/location\/yallingup-margaret-river\/\">BODHI Yallingup<\/a> will open it&#8217;s doors late September 2022, offering a new level of immersive wellness experiences in the South West region.
