The word Chakra translates to \u2018wheel\u2019 in Sanskrit.\u00a0The Chakras correspond to organs and nerves in the body, and when spinning freely, energy flows through the being,\u00a0and you are in alignment.<\/p>\n<h3>How many Chakras are in the body?<\/h3>\n<p>There are thousands of Chakras throughout the body, with seven major chakras that run along spine from the base (your most physical chakra) to your crown (most spiritual chakra). The even numbered Chakras correspond to feminine energy, whilst the odd numbered chakras correspond to the masculine energy. The Crown Chakra is where male and female become unified, and it is said to be your umbilical cord to the universe.<\/p>\n<h3>What does it mean when you have a blockage in the Chakra? How does it feel?<\/h3>\n<p>When a Chakra is blocked is means the energy is stuck and cannot flow freely through. It can manifest in an emotional way, for example, feeling unsettled, angry, indecisive, insecure, fearful, or physically, for example, via gut or bowel issues, hormone imbalances, arthritis and injuries.<\/p>\n<h3>What causes blockages in the Chakras?<\/h3>\n<p>It can manifest as a physical issue, for example a blockage in arteries, a cyst, being constipated, excess weight, poor diet, lack of exercise, stress, lack of sleep.\u00a0It can also manifest emotionally, via stored emotions from the past or anxiety, depression, or insecurity, blocking the energy flow of a Chakra.<\/p>\n<h3>Tell us about the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/product\/bodhi-chakra-balance\/\">BODHI Chakra Balance Treatment<\/a>. How does it work and why is it so special?<\/h3>\n<p>It is an extremely powerful holistic treatment. It works on a physical, emotional, and spiritual level. Using a combination of massage, energy work, crystal placement and Chakra aromatherapy blends, the therapist works intuitively to bring your body back into balance and free up energy flow.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a way to bring someone back to a place of balance and self-awareness, which is really special.<\/p>\n<h3>How do you feel when you give guests the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/product\/bodhi-chakra-balance\/\">BODHI Chakra Balance Treatment<\/a>?<\/h3>\n<p>My job as a therapist is to stay as clear as I can during treatment, so that I can tune into the needs of the guest intuitively on that day. I go into a meditative state, and I\u2019m always amazed how the body guides as to what it needs. I feel very privileged introducing people to healing treatments and seeing the effect it has on their state of wellbeing.<\/p>\n<h3>What can you do to support your Chakras at home?<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>GET CREATIVE<\/strong> &#8211; Ask yourself what are you passionate about? Get back to doing what you love. Being creative is a form of active meditation whether it\u2019s writing, painting, drawing, gardening, cooking etc It is an activity where your mind is present and it\u2019s a creative outlet that comes from the heart.<\/li>\n<li><strong>MOVE YOUR BODY<\/strong> &#8211; Our bodies are like a river &#8211; when they are moving they are clean and clear. When they are still for too long they become stagnated. Get out into nature and go for a gentle walk. Do some yoga. Go for a swim.<\/li>\n<li><strong>BREATH WORK<\/strong> &#8211; It is the digestive system for our emotions. If any uncomfortable emotions come up and you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed practice box breathing. In for four counts&#8230; hold for four counts &#8230;out for four counts&#8230;hold for four counts. Repeat until you feel re-centred.<\/li>\n<li><strong>AROMATHERAPY BLENDS<\/strong> &#8211; Try the Sodashi Chakra Balance Aromatherapy Blends, they are used in the BODHI Chakra Balance treatment, and you can purchase them at BODHI Spas or online. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bodhispa.com\/product\/chakra-balance-4-love-10ml\/\">Chakra Balance 4: Love<\/a>, for example is amazing for supporting self-care and self-love, as well as love for others.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We spoke to Asha King, BODHI Senior Therapist and Spa Trainer about Chakras, what they are, and how you can support them for your own wellbeing. &nbsp; What are Chakras?
