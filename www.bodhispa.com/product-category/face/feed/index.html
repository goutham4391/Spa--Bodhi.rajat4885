					<description><![CDATA[At the heart of this ultra-luxe oil cleanser are 23 of the world’s most nutrient rich phyto actives chosen for their performance in hydrating, brightening, and smoothing the skin’s complexion.

This next generation formula soaks the skin in phytonutrients and fatty acids to hydrate and smooth the look of skin. It also includes neuropeptides and miracle super oil, Camelia oil, which is high in polyphenols - these ingredients are our secret to a dewy, fresh complexion.

Upon contact with water, this high performing cleanser transforms into a milky emulsion to ensure a residue free, toned and radiant finish.]]></description>
