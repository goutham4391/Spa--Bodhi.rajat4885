					<description><![CDATA[Beauty sleep in a bottle - Emma Lewisham's pioneering Sleeping Mask is a highly concentrated, at-home skin treatment for dramatically elevated results in skin regeneration.

Specialised Gardenia Jasminoides Extract works by enhancing the skin's natural night-time restoration by boosting the activation of our skin's melatonin receptors, which trigger night-time cellular repair, renewal and regeneration processes. While you sleep, 22 active ingredients work to powerfully rejuvenate the skin - regenerating collagen, stimulating cell turnover, removing toxins and repairing the skin barrier for visibly brighter, plumper, firmer and deeply nourished skin by morning.

Designed to work synergistically with the skin, this skin-elevating formula taps into and amplifies our natural night-time skin cycle to unlock unparalleled results.]]></description>
