<h3>100% natural, backed by science.</h3>
<h4>Contains: bioactive collagen + kakadu plum + lutein &#38; zeaxanthin (marigold extracts) + zinc + vitamin C + vitamin E + biotin</h4>
GLOWSO™ Skin Health and Glow Formula is naturopath-formulated to transform your skin from the inside out. This unique blend combines sustainable sourced bioactive collagen, Kakadu Plum, Marigold Extracts, Vitamin B7, Vitamin E and Zinc.

The bioactive collagen stimulates skin metabolism for noticeably firmer, smoother skin. Skin surface structure is improved, cellulite is reduced and nail growth is faster, with reportedly less chipping of fingernails.

Kakadu Plum is the world’s highest natural source of Vitamin C, and is extremely beneficial for skin health and repair, and for collagen production. The Kakadu Plum in GLOWSO™ is sourced from NAAKPA (Northern Australian Aboriginal Kakadu Plum Alliance).

Powerful antioxidants Zeathanthin and Lutein, extracts from the Marigold flower, work to reduce free radicals formed in the body to protect from the inside out.
